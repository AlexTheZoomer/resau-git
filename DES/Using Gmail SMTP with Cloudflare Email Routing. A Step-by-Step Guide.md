## Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

To proceed with this method, ensure that you have enabled [two-factor authentication](https://safety.google/authentication/) for your Google account. If you haven't done so already, you can follow the link to set it up ‚Üí [Enable 2FA in your Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification).  You'll want to ensure that you remember to **remove** this, or be ready to transfer when your term comes to an end. 

## Step 2: Create an App Password for Mail

In your Google account settings, create an App Password specifically for Mail. Follow this link to create the App Password ‚Üí [Create an App Password](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords) (You will need to copy and use this password later along with your Gmail address in the Google SMTP server settings in the "Add another email address" form).

## Step 3: Add Your Cloudflare-Routed Email Address to Gmail

Open Gmail and navigate to Settings ‚Üí Accounts ‚Üí **Send mail as**. 
In this section, click on "Add another email address" and fill out the form with your name and your Cloudflare-routed email address. 
Untick the "Treat as an alias" option and click on "Next Step."


## Step 4: Fill Out the Next Form

**SMTP Server:** `smtp.gmail.com`  
**Port:** `587`  
**Username:** Your Gmail address (including `@gmail.com`)  
**Password:** The App Password you generated in Step 2  
Leave **TLS enabled**  
Click on **Add Account**

You will receive an email from Gmail asking you to confirm ownership by providing a code. 
Enter the code in the dialog box or click the link provided in the confirmation email to complete the process.
## Step 5: Update Email Settings in Your Google Account

Navigate to your [email settings](https://myaccount.google.com/email) and scroll down to the ‚ÄúAlternate Emails‚Äù section.

## Step 6: Add Cloudflare-Routed Email Address

Add your Cloudflare-routed email address as an alternate email.

## Step 7: Confirm Alternate Email

Wait for an email from Google and confirm your alternate email. 

I had an issue where the added email wasn't coming through for the first few hours‚Ä¶ Google may be rate limiting your address (slowing you down). It took me a few hours before the email would come through. 

Sorry for the wait ü§∑

## Step 8: Set Custom Email as Default

In Gmail, navigate to Settings ‚Üí Accounts ‚Üí Send mail as, and set your custom email as the default. This step ensures that your profile picture is associated with your outgoing emails.

## Step 10: Set your Primary Address as your New Address



You'll want to head over to your Gmail settings, and set your new address as your default address for the account.  
## That's it!

You have successfully configured Gmail SMTP with Cloudflare Email Routing. 
Now, when composing a new message in Gmail, you can select your new email address from the list. 
Additionally, when replying to an email received at your new address, the new address should automatically populate in the **From:** field.
