Complex numbers are a funny thing. Complex numbers are numbers that are made up a "real component", and an "imaginary component".

Let Z = A complex number

$$
Z = X + iY
$$

There also exists what is known as the ***complex conjugate***. The complex conjugate is described as:

$$
\bar{Z} = X - iY
$$


- X and Y are real numbers, with i being an *imaginary component*. Y here is scaling the imaginary component.

 To find the magnitude of Z, you can 
 $$
 |Z| = \sqrt{a^2 +b^2}
 $$

$$
i = \sqrt{-1}
$$
$$
i^2 = -1
$$
Complex numbers can be:

- Added
- Subtracted
- Multiplied 
- Divided

Complex numbers can also be found in **polar form**. **Polar form is made up of:**
$$
z = |z|e^{i\theta}
$$

The magnitude of Z, times *Euler's formula*. *Euler's formula* is:
$$
e^{i\theta}=cos\theta + isin\theta
$$
-

The last thing to talk about here, is **Demoivre's Theorem**.
$$
(e^{i\theta})^n = e^{in\theta}
$$ 
It is a method of proving trigonometric identities.
