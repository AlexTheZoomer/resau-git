- Inductors oppose change in current!

Kirchhoff's Law!  (Now, we are going to tailor it to our specific system!)

$$
\frac{1}{c}Q + (L)\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2}=0
$$
- This is a differential equation! 

- The first term represents the capacitor, and the second represents the inductor!

Looking at the oscilloscope, we end up with this function!

$$
Q(t) = Q_{max}cos(\omega t)
$$
- Knowing this now, we can plug that back in to receive another equation

$$
\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
$$
**Ï‰** = Angular Frequency (rads/sec)
L =  Self Inductance (H, Henrys) 
C = Coulombs (C)
T = Period (Seconds)

$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
$$
$$
T = 2\pi\sqrt{LC}
$$
