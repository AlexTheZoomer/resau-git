Before we begin!

I would like to give a special thank you to:

- [Dr Simon DeVet](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/physics/faculty-staff/Faculty/SimondeVet.html), Professor of Physics and Atmospheric Science at Dalhousie University

For their contributions in my knowledge of EM physics. The following notes are my first year class notes for EM physics, and I hope you may find them helpful! I've got a few less than [[linalg|Linear Algebra]] sadly, but this is what I've got.
