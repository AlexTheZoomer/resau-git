### Mutual Induction

Variant of Faraday's Law

$$\epsilon_2 = -M \frac{dI_1}{dt}$$

**Ïµ** = EMF (V)
M = Mutual Inductance (H, Henrys)
I = Current (A)

- This is how wireless charging works! The magnetic field can transfer power! 
- Two coils interacting with each other

---
$$\frac{\epsilon_2}{\epsilon_1} = \frac{N_2}{N_1}$$
**Ïµ** = EMF (V)
N = Number of Turns

- The ratio in between the two EMF's is the same as the ratio in between the amount of turns of looped wire!
- These are how **transformers work**. You can step higher voltage down to lower voltage. Power brick transformers step 120V down to 12V for our devices!
- Going from low voltage to high voltage works this way, (12V-120V), but there will always be a trade off.  
- (eg, more loops equals more resistance, (V=IR), so your voltage may be higher, but the current will drop)

##### Transformers!

### Self Inductance

$$\epsilon = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
**Ïµ** = EMF (V)
L= Self Inductance (H, Henrys)
I = Current (A)

- L, the curly thing in the circuit, is an **INDUCTOR**

Current change over time due to this EMF

#### Closing the Switch (Current growing to max)

Current at a time:
$$I(t) = I_{max}(1-e^{-\frac{1}{\tau}})$$

Time Constant:
$$\tau = \frac{L}{R}$$
Half Time:
$$t_{\frac{1}{2}} = 0.69\tau$$

#### Opening the Switch (Current going from max to 0A)

Current at a time:
$$I(t) = I_{max}e^{-\frac{1}{\tau}}$$
Time Constant:
$$\tau = \frac{L}{R}$$

- This is cool, because this is how surge protectors work! 
- The exponential growth slows surging current, and a high inductance can slow surges. 
- The slope is nicer to electronics

#### Inductors can store and release energy! 

- This can be defined by the following equation 

$$U = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$$
U = Energy stored/released
L = Self Inductance (H, Henrys)
I = Current (A)
