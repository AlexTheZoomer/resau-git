### Capacitors in Series 

$$
\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_{1}}  + \frac{1}{C_{2}}
$$
$$
\Delta V = {\Delta V_{1}}  + {\Delta V_{2}}
$$
$$
Q = Q_2 = Q_1
$$

### Capacitors in Parallel


$$
{C_{eq}} = {C_{1}}  + {C_{2}}
$$
$$
Q = {Q_{1}}  + {Q_{2}}
$$
$$
\Delta V = {\Delta V_{1}}  = {\Delta V_{2}}
$$

### General Formulas

$$
\Delta V = \frac{Q}{C}
$$
$$
Q=C_{eq}\Delta V
$$


- This is all very similar to V = IR
- Q would replace I, and C would replace R
