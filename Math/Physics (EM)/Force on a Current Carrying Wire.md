$$
F =\sum q \hat{v} \times \hat{B}
$$

- Sum of all charges
$$\hat{F} = I\hat{l} \times \hat{B}$$



- Little L  = Length of wire in B field, in the same direction as I (Meters)
- I = Current (Amps)
- B = Magnetic Field (Teslas)

### Torque

$$ \tau = IAB$$

Ï„ = Torque
A = Area of the loop
B = Magnetic Field

- This is true for any loop!

### Rotational Motion

- Rotation is done by interaction in between a charged wire and a magnetic field. 

- Work is being done here, however, it is ***not*** being done by the magnetic force. The electric potential is doing the work on the object. 

For a smaller torque, you can take

$$\tau =IABsin\theta$$
But, this can also be defined as

Torque up = Counterclockwise motion
Torque down = Clockwise Motion
