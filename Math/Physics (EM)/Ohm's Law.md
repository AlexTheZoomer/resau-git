### Current

- Current has units of (Columbs per Second), or (Amperes)
$$
I= \frac{dQ}{dt}
$$

- Current Density is the current per area

$$
J = \frac{I}{A}
$$
- Current measures the movement of coulombs through a wire, or a measured point on a wire.

### Charge Density

- Charge density is a property of a material
- It is based of of the amount of charges per unit m<sup>3</sup>
- n = Charge Density (Given constant, property of material)
- nq = Charge per m<sup>3</sup>
- If you multiply nq by speed V, it measures the charge passing through an area per unit time (Current Density)

$$ J = vnq$$
$$\frac{I}{A} = vnq$$
$$V=\frac{I}{Anq}$$

### Resistivity

- Electrons move relatively slowly through a wire (still very fast, 2.3x10<sup>-5</sup> m/s for a copper wire)
- They do so because as charges move through the wire, they bump into molecules and elements of the wire itself.

$$
\rho = \frac{E}{J}
$$

- E = Electric Field
- J = Current Density
- œÅ = Resistivity 

Resistivity œÅ is a property of the material itself. It is measured in units of (Volt meters/Amps)

Examples

- Copper: œÅ = 1.68x10<sup>-8</sup> Vm/A    (Not very resistive)
- Carbon: œÅ = 5.00x10<sup>-4</sup> Vm/A    (Some resistance)
- Wood:   œÅ = 10<sup>-4</sup> Vm/A             (a lot of  resistance)

### Resistance

Resistance (R), unlike Resistivity is a property of the object itself. It is measured in units of (Ohms)

- R has a unit of ohms

$$
R =(\frac{L\rho}{A})$$
$$\Delta V = I(\frac{L\rho}{A})$$
and the big concept of resistance is 

$$\Delta V = IR$$

### Power

Power (p) is the energy "lost" per unit time

$$P =\frac{dw}{dt} = \Delta V \frac{dq}{dt}$$
$$P=\Delta V I$$
$$P = I^2R$$
$$P=\Delta \frac{V^2}{R}$$

- Power has units of [J/S] (Joules per Second) or [W]
- 60 Watts would be equivalent to 60 Joules of energy being lost per second
- Resistance creates heat, and in extreme cases, light. 
- This is a dissipation of energy
- This is a consequent of work.

#### Work 

Work is required to move a charge
As speed is constant, Kinetic Energy never changes.
