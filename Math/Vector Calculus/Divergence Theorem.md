##### Divergence Theorem

$$
\oint\oint \vec{F}\cdot \hat{N}ds
$$
- Remember, this is on a closed surface!
- F dot N is meaning the flux in the N direction
- N is the normal vector to the surface (points outwards)

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} =\text{   Divergence of F} =\text{Rate spreading away from the point} = \text{Source (sink)}
$$

$$
\iiint_{Vol} \nabla \cdot \vec{F} dvol = \text{Total source inside volume}
$$

So, what we can say is that...

$$
\iiint_{Vol} \nabla \cdot \vec{F} dvol = \oint\oint \vec{F}\cdot \hat{N}ds 
$$
And this is the **divergence theorem!**
Divergence theorem calculates the total flux of a field through a surface

In 2D, this would be Green's Theorem!

- Reminder! GRADIENT IS THE N, Normal value
