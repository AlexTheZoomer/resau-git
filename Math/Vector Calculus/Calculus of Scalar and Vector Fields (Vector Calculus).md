### Scalar Fields

- Scalar Functions = f(x), f(x,y), f(x,y,z)
- Think of x,y,z as space (3D)
- Temperature T(x,y,z), is a ***scalar field***
- The gradient of a scalar field, is a ***vector field***
----
### Vector Fields

Vector = magnitude and direction
- Velocity, Acceleration, Force

- When vectors vary in space, you have a vector field.

$$\vec{v}(x,y,z =v_x,v_y,v_z)$$
$$v_z(x,y,z)$$

- Each component of a vector field can vary in space, and contains a scalar field. 


##### Important Properties of Vector Fields

- Every field has the following properties that can be observed/studied/
- These properties can tell us how a field varies in space

- Gradience
- Divergence
- Curl 

- **Divergence** is result of dot product, and measures 3 of the three derivatives available
	- Divergence measures the "Flow" of a point. If there's stuff going in, or stuff going out of a point


- **Curl** is the result of cross product, and measures the other 6 of the derivatives available 
	- Curl measures the "Rotation or swirl" around a point
	- If in 2D for curl, you must only keep the last term. 


### Special Cases 

a) Conservative
	When v =âˆ‡f     (f is the potential function for v)

Some examples of where this can occur:

- Electrical Force                  Electrical Potential

- Magnetic Force                 Magnetic Potential

- Gravitational Force            Gravatational Potential

**This case occurs when the curl = 0**
