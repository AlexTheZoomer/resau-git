- Functions of several variables is usually found in things with physical quantities 
	- Particularly, physical quantities that vary in space and time (temperature in a room, pressure density in the ocean, etc. )

- Often with these functions of several variables, one may need to calculate things like rate of change, approximation, minimums, maximums, and other traditional calculus operations.

<u>Functions of 1 Variable </u>
- Y =f(x)
- r(t) = (f(t), g(t))
- r(t) = (x, y(x))

One input, and one output...

<u>Functions of 2 Variables</u>
- Known as "surface equations"
