- dT/ds (derivative of the Unit Tangent with respect to S) = rate of change in direction as we move along the curve.
- ||dT/ds|| = "curviness" of the curve, **curvature**
- κ = Curvature = ∥∥dT/ds∥∥
- **ρ** = 1/κ = Radius of curvature
### Curvature

- Here, we see that when looking at curvature, you can imagine a circle that is tangent to a space curve.
- A sharper curve would indicate a smaller tangent circle
- A straight part of the curve would indicate that there is zero curvature
- The radius of curvature (**ρ**) is the radius of that tangent circle

### Torsion

τ = Torsion 
   = twistiness of the curve 
   = rate of change of direction at B as we move along the curve 
   = **||dB/ds||** <-- GENERAL FORM
