### Triple Integrals 

- No different than a double integral, other than the fact that you need to integrate three times instead of two

$$
f(x,y,z) => \iiint f(x,y,z) dVol
$$

- Unfortunately, there isn't a good geometric interpretation. (4D ish...)
- We are integrating in terms of volume (dzdydx)

**The trickiest part of these questions is defining the initial volume** 

 A couple of things to note
 - To find a point of intersection, set both functions equal to each other
 - And make the equation in terms of what you are solving for
