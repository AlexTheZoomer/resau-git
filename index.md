## 🎋 Introduction

Hi there 😊

My name is Alexandre, and I am an Electrical Engineering student at [Dalhousie University 🐯](https://www.dal.ca/). 

![[PXL_20230809_155103802~3.jpg]]

On this site, I hope to publish notes about projects that I am working on, guides, UNIX, Programming, and Mathematics. My main site, [cabot.place](https://cabot.place/) doesn't, and I imagine never will have much on it. It's got a funny spinning (entirely CSS) triangle though! 

This site is being run on my Dell PowerEdge R715 homelab server, being routed through NGINX, and Cloudflare to the open web.  This web base is written entirely in `Markdown`, being interpreted by [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) into HTML. 

## 🖨️ Some of my Current Projects:

- [🗃️ Dell PowerEdge R715 Restoration | Homelab Project](poweredge.md)
	- VSphere, XCP-NG and finally, Proxmox
	- Proxmox Services Tree
	- [[imessage|🍎 MacOS Monterey Installation, with working IServices and Hardware Acceleration, on a Dual AMD Opteron 6380 server.]]
<br>
- Guides on Mathematics for those like I... (challenged)
	- [🧮 Vector Calculus](vec.md)
	- [🟰 Linear Algebra](linalg.md)
	- [[phys|🧲 Electromagnetics and Circuits]]
<br>
- My Academic Papers
	- [[nationalcharge|🚙 National Charge: Canadian Federal EV Standards Regulation]]
	- [[importanceoffoss|💾 The Vital Importance of FOSS:The GNU/Linux Operating System]]

 I hope you can learn something from me, and am always happy to respond to emails!
